# ATM-project


Started off by creating a class of a bank user
And then from there what  I did was to do getters and setters for the client's information

From there i did a void containing print options of what the bank would display when the client is logged in e.g Withdrawal, Balance, Deposit and exit.
Each option had a specific function.

A small list DB was created since there was no database for a few users.

When the user enters their information it is checked in the small Database i have created.
